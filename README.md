# governing-equations
This project is a in-class study case to understand SINDy algorithm. 

This sparse identificiation method is developed by Dr. Steven L. Brunton et.al

- citation2: Inferring Biological Networks by Sparse Identification fo Nonlinear Dynamics, (Brunton Group, Niall Mangan), IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications

Here, we transimitted this method from MATLAB to python, and also applied this method to several biological systems.
- Lorenz system 
- Michaelis Menten (enzyme kinetics)
- SEIR (disease transmission model)
- RSM (antibiotic resistance gene transfer model)

Denoise algorithms and new information criteria of model selection were proposed in this code.

There are several documents is in good shape (final version):
1. final_v1 folder, in which contains one utils.py and four .ipynb
  - Utlis.py contains all functions/ algorithms that is utlized in system identification
  - Four .ipynb, each one shows one example of the governing equation. 
2. figures folder, in which contains all figures we generate 
3. GBCB_5874_report.pdf, final report

Others are the reduancy files(drafts)
