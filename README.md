# governing-equations
This project is a in-class study case to understand SINDy algorithm. 

This sparse identificiation method is developed by Dr. Steven L. Brunton et.al (citation: Discovering governing equations from data by sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems, PNAS)

Here, we transimitted this method from MATLAB to python, and also applied this method to several biological systems. Denoise algorithms and new index of model selection were proposed in this code.
