# governing-equations
This project is a in-class study case to understand SINDy algorithm. 

This sparse identificiation method is developed by Dr. Steven L. Brunton et.al (citation: Discovering governing equations from data by sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems, PNAS)

Here, we transimitted this method from MATLAB to python, and also applied this method to several biological systems.
- Lorenz system 
- Michaelis Menten (enzyme kinetics)
- SEIR (disease transmission model)
- RSM (antibiotic resistance gene transfer model)

Denoise algorithms and new information criteria of model selection were proposed in this code.

There are several documents is in good shape (final version):
1. final_v1 folder, in which contains one utils.py and four .ipynb
  - Utlis.py contains all functions/ algorithms that is utlized in system identification
  - Four .ipynb, each one shows one example of the governing equation. 
2. figures folder, in which contains all figures we generate 
3. final report.pdf
Others are the reduancy files(drafts)
